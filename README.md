This project was part of a university course analyzing illustrations of historic kids books with the help of AI (university of Leipzig, 2024, Computational Humanities).
As AI was trained predominantly on modern images, the leading research question was how well different AI models can recognize, describe and classify images produced with historic techniques between 1801 and 1914.
My project focused on the decorative ornaments surrounding those illustrations, sorting them into the categories 'plants', 'animals', 'abstract geometrical shapes', 'simple line', 'banner/arch', 'letters/text', 'no ornament' and 'other motives'.
I categorized a corpus of 85 images with the model GPT 4o and manually, in order to compare the quality of the ornament classification.
